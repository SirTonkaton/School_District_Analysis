# School District Analysis 

## Overview of Project

As evidence came to surface about academic dishonesty from the provided results of 9th graders at Thomas High School, all the data from the School District had to be re-evaluated in order to comprehend how all the different schools are performing. It is important to evaluate such data as the goal would be to mimic the results of those high performing High Schools in hopes of increasing students passing percentage. Evidence will show that as the number of students increases, the % Overall Passing scores start to drop.    

## Analysis

Once the scores for "Math" and "Reading" for 9th graderrs at Thomas Highschool were ommitted, we can see a small reduction of almost 1 % on the Overall Passing percentage for the district.

#### School Summary

Thomas High School seems to be one of the top performers in the school district. As you will see below, even after removing results for 9th graders the impact to the school was minimal.

However, not making the necesary adjustments to the tables, Thomas High School could've been hurt with a 65.07 % on their Overall Passing Rate.
